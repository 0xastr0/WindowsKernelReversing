# WindowsInternals 
A repo to share my experiments while playing with Windows Internals. This include reversed functions from ntoskrnl.exe, drivers, etc ...  

The decompiled code is based on IDA hex rays decompiler but I fixed types, added comments and renamed some stuff. Keep in mind not all the decompiled code is intended to be working.
