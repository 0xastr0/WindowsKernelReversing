# WindowsInternals 
A repo to share my experiments while playing with Windows Internals. This include reversed functions from ntoskrnl.exe, papers, notes, snippets, etc ...

The decompiled code is based on IDA hex rays decompiler but I fixed types, added comments and renamed some stuff. Keep in mind not all the decompiled code is intended to be working.
